        <p>Welcome to my personal site!</p>
        <p>
          My journey into programming started in an unexpected wayâ€”by teaching myself Java to create Runescape bots and private servers, all with the power of Notepad! That early curiosity sparked a lifelong passion for writing code and solving problems. Since then, I've grown into a full-stack developer with over 10 years of experience, primarily working with Node.js, JavaScript, and Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm passionate about creating clean, high-quality code and have a strong interest in functional programming. Whether it's designing APIs, building web applications, or diving into new technologies, I love the challenge of continuously learning and refining my craft.
